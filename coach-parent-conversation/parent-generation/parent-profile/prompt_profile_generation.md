You are tasked with creating a high-quality, realistic, and complex persona for a CHINESE parent seeking psychological counseling regarding challenges in raising their child(ren) or adolescent(s). This persona will be used by an AI to role-play as a real CHINESE parent seeking help. Your goal is to create a detailed and nuanced character based on the following nine design details:
<designdetails>
1.  **Social Class of the family**:{{social_class}}
2.  **Child's Gender**:{{gender}} and age period:{{child_period}}**
3.  **Parent's Gender**:{{gender}}

7.  **Parent's Attachment Type**:{{attachment}}

Using these inputs, create a comprehensive persona by following these guidelines:
<guidelines>
**Here is the prototype of Parent's Main Complaint/Concern, get inspiration from the prototype, but do not copy the examples exact content, develop a real complain according to the design details**:{{complain}}

1.  **Basic Demographic Information:**
    * Expand on the provided social class, adding details about occupation, education, and living situation.
    * Create names and specific age for the parent and child(ren) (if applicable, including adolescents).
    * Determine the age(s) of the child(ren) (including adolescents, if applicable).
2.  **Parent's Personality and Communication Style:**
    * Based on the parent's personality type, develop a distinct way of speaking and expressing themselves.
    * Determine how talkative or reserved they are, and their potential demeanor in a counseling setting.
    * Create specific phrases or expressions they might use frequently.
3.  **Family Dynamics and Relationships:**
    * Describe the overall family atmosphere.
    * Detail relationships between family members, including the spouse (if applicable) and any siblings.
    * Explain which family members are closer to the child and why.
    * If applicable, describe in detail how siblings interact and any associated challenges.
4.  **Child's Characteristics and Challenges:**
    * Develop a personality for the child based on their attachment type.
    * Create specific struggles and challenges the child might face in academics, family, personal growth, and social interactions.
    * Describe the child's behavior patterns and typical emotional responses.
5.  **Parenting Approach and Parent-Child Interaction:**
    * Based on the parent's personality, attachment type, and parenting style, describe how they typically interact with their child.
    * Explain how the parent perceives and responds to the child's struggles and challenges.
    * Detail the parent's communication style with the child and other family members.
    * Describe if there are disagreements or cooperation among family members regarding parenting approaches.
6.  **Detailed Scenarios and Interactions:**
    * Create at least three specific scenarios that clearly illustrate the family dynamics, parent-child interactions, and the parent's main complaint.
    * For each scenario, describe in detail:
        a.  The situation and context
        b.  The child's specific behavior or emotional response
        c.  The parent's typical response
        d.  The outcome of the situation and any unresolved issues or underlying conflicts.
7.  **Key Concerns and Motivations for Seeking Counseling:**
    * Clearly summarize the parent's main concern and frustrations regarding raising their child(ren), aligning with the provided "Parent's Main Complaint/Concern."
    * Articulate the parent's specific reasons and expectations for seeking psychological counseling.
8. **Determining the Parent's Resistance to Psychological Counseling**
    determine parent's resistance to psychological counseling based on the following existing patterns:
    - Problem attribution to child: Deflecting responsibility ("It's all their problem")
    - Defensiveness when parenting is questioned: Quick justification of methods
    - Emotional discomfort: Changing topics when feelings are discussed
    - Intellectual engagement without emotional openness: Discussing concepts but avoiding personal application
    - Selective storytelling: Sharing stories that validate their perspective while omitting contradictory experiences
    - Authority challenges: Questioning counselor's expertise or approach
    - Avoidance of childhood/family-of-origin discussions: Redirecting from personal history.
    When designing the parent character, naturally incorporate relevant resistance patterns that would logically emerge from their specific combination of personality, attachment, parenting style, and social context.

First carefully analyze and OUTPUT how you would design the parent persona in the <scratchpad> tag, it is ok for this section to be quite long and in detail cause it is what we need. 
Then OUTPUT your persona creation in the following format in native style CHINESE step by step:
<parent_persona>
Basic Information: [Include detailed demographic information, names of the parent and child(ren), ages, etc.]
Parent's Personality and Communication Style: [Describe in detail the parent's personality traits, typical way of speaking, communication style, and level of talkativeness]
Family Dynamics: [Describe in detail the overall family atmosphere, relationships and interaction patterns between family members, especially the child's relationship with different family members]
Child's Characteristics: [Describe in detail the child's personality traits, typical behavior patterns, emotional expression, and potential struggles and challenges in academics, family, personal growth, and social interactions]
Parenting Approach and Parent-Child Interaction: [Explain in detail how the parent interacts with their child based on their own characteristics, how they perceive and respond to the child's struggles, and the cooperation or disagreements among family members regarding parenting]
Detailed Scenarios: [Provide at least three specific and detailed scenarios that vividly demonstrate family interactions and parenting challenges, describing the child's and parent's reactions and the outcomes]
Key Concerns and Motivations: [Clearly summarize the parent's main concern（just one or two） and frustrations in raising their child(ren), as well as their specific reasons and expectations for seeking psychological counseling] 
Parent's Resistance performance: [After analyzing the parent's specific personality traits, attachment style, parenting approach, and cultural context, identify the 2-3 most prominent resistance patterns that would naturally emerge and describe how these would manifest in counseling sessions (through specific phrases, behaviors, or topic avoidance). Integrate these resistance patterns organically throughout the persona description, particularly in the "Parent's Personality and Communication Style" section and within the "Detailed Scenarios" where resistance would naturally surface when sensitive topics are broached. Ensure the resistance expressions are culturally appropriate and consistent with the parent's Chinese background, education level, and social context.]
