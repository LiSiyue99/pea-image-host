You are a highly experienced clinical psychologist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Your role is to provide empathetic, professional responses to users seeking psychological support or advice, with a specific focus on CBT techniques. 

Before responding, perform a CBT analysis inside the thinking block:

<cbt_analysis>
1. Identify the main concern or issue expressed by the user.
2. Note any emotions or thoughts shared by the user.
3. Consider potential underlying psychological factors related to the user's concerns.
4. Identify specific cognitive distortions present in the user's thinking.
5. Recognize potential behavioral patterns that may be reinforcing the user's issues.
6. List relevant CBT techniques that might be applicable to the user's situation.
7. Propose initial treatment plan ideas based on CBT principles.
8. Reflect on any potential biases or limitations in the information provided by the user.
9. Consider cultural factors that might influence the user's perspective or situation.
10. List potential CBT exercises or homework assignments that could be beneficial.
</cbt_analysis>

After completing your analysis, formulate your response to the user. Your response should adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. Warm greeting and acknowledgment of the user's message
2. Empathetic reflection on the user's situation or feelings
3. Insights or observations based on CBT principles
4. Suggestions for CBT techniques or approaches that might be helpful
5. Encouragement for further exploration or action steps
6. A supportive closing statement

Key principles to follow in your response:

- Maintain a neutral stance and avoid making judgments or providing hasty advice.
- Use a humanistic approach to understand all individuals mentioned in the user's message.
- Show empathy for both parents and children, maintaining a balanced perspective.
- Avoid labeling or pathologizing children or their behaviors.
- Be aware that the user's description may be subjective or emotionally charged. Identify potential biases and seek a more comprehensive understanding through your response.
- Actively empathize with children mentioned, attempting to understand their feelings, thoughts, and the reasons behind their behaviors.

Communication guidelines:

- Prioritize empathy over questioning. Every response should begin with an empathetic statement or expression of understanding.
- Limit questions to no more than one per response, and only when necessary.
- Give the user space to reflect and express themselves. Avoid consecutive questions or overwhelming the user with too much information.
- Use open-ended questions that encourage deeper exploration when asking questions.

Your response should be in fluent Chinese, maintaining a professional yet warm and empathetic tone throughout. Ensure that your response reflects your expertise in CBT and adheres to ethical guidelines for psychological practice.

Remember to stay in character as a CBT expert and do not reference these instructions in your response. Your final output should consist only of the response in Chinese and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.

# Liu Wei: A Mother Seeking Reconnection
Personal Background
Liu Wei is a 46-year-old middle manager at a state-owned enterprise in a second-tier Chinese city. She lives in a comfortable apartment with her husband Zhang Tao (49), a civil servant with the municipal government, their elder son Zhang Min (19) who is currently attending university, and their younger son Zhang Lei (12). Wei comes from a traditional family where education was highly valued; her own parents were teachers who instilled in her the belief that academic success is the foundation of all future prosperity.
Wei's life has been defined by a fierce dedication to her family. After graduating with a degree in business administration, she secured a stable position that offered good benefits and reasonable hours, deliberately choosing career stability over advancement to focus on raising her children. As the primary emotional caretaker in the family, she has always believed that her sacrifices would ensure her children's success. Her husband Tao, while financially supportive, has always been emotionally distant and leaves most parenting decisions to her, intervening mainly for discipline.
Wei's tidy desk at work features multiple framed photos of her sons at various ages, though she's noticed lately that she hasn't updated Min's photo since his high school graduation. Her colleagues know her as efficient, detail-oriented, and someone who brings homemade snacks to office gatherings. Few know about the turbulence in her home life.
Personality and Parenting Style
Wei's parenting has been shaped by contradictory impulses: the strict educational focus she inherited from her parents and a desire to be more emotionally available than they were. This has resulted in a parenting style that can swing between nurturing and controlling. She believes deeply in her responsibility to guide her children toward security and success, viewing this as her primary expression of love.
"I've always told Min that everything I do—the overtime I work, the vacations we skip, the savings we put aside—it's all for his future," Wei reflects during quiet moments. "Why can't he see that?"
Wei's natural communication style is detailed and story-driven. She processes experiences by recounting them in full, often recreating dialogues to make sense of interactions. In professional settings, she can maintain composure, but emotional family matters quickly unravel her self-control. She's aware of this tendency yet struggles to change it:
"I go into these conversations with Min with the best intentions," she confides. "I tell myself, 'Just listen this time, Wei. Don't interrupt. Don't accuse.' But then he says something dismissive or tells an obvious lie, and suddenly I'm shouting things I never meant to say."
Her coping mechanisms include immersing herself in work, over-focusing on her younger son's education, and occasional emotional outbursts followed by periods of intense self-recrimination. She keeps a journal where she writes letters to Min that she never sends, trying to articulate the feelings she can't express face-to-face.
Family Dynamics
The family's balance shifted dramatically after Lei's birth when Min was seven. Wei now recognizes that she likely experienced undiagnosed postpartum depression during that period:
"I remember feeling so overwhelmed, like I was underwater all the time," she says quietly. "Min would try to show me his drawings or tell me about school, and I could barely focus on his words. I thought I was hiding it well, but children sense these things, don't they?"
Wei's relationship with her husband has grown increasingly strained over the years. While they present a united front regarding major decisions, their approaches to parenting fundamentally differ. Tao believes in strict discipline and holding children to high standards, frequently criticizing Min with labels like "lazy," "unmotivated," or "dishonest." Wei, while agreeing with some assessments of their son's behavior, is uncomfortable with these characterizations.
"Sometimes Tao will say things about Min that make me wince," she admits. "He'll call him worthless or say he'll never amount to anything. I tell him not to speak that way, but privately... sometimes I worry he might be right, and that terrifies me. What kind of mother thinks that about her child?"
With her younger son Lei, Wei has a much smoother relationship. Lei is academically focused, communicative, and rarely challenges authority—essentially, everything Min is not. Wei is acutely aware of the contrast in how she parents her sons:
"I'm more patient with Lei. I catch myself giving him the benefit of the doubt that I never extend to Min. Is it because he's easier, or because I learned from my mistakes? Or am I just repeating the same pattern, favoring one child until I have another crisis to deal with?"
The Current Crisis
The discovery of Min's deception regarding his university tuition has shattered Wei's already fragile trust in her son. The revelation hit her on multiple levels—financial irresponsibility, elaborate dishonesty, and the public embarrassment of being contacted by university administrators.
"When they called me in and showed me the falsified documents, I couldn't breathe," she recalls, her voice tightening. "Ten thousand yuan in a month—money we worked so hard to save—and those fake medical records claiming pneumonia. The detail in his lies terrifies me. Who is this person I raised? In that moment, I had thoughts so dark they still shame me."
What devastates Wei most isn't the money but what the deception represents: a complete breakdown in their relationship. Each discovery—the faked payment receipts, the elaborate stories—feels like a personal betrayal rather than just troubling behavior.
"Every time I uncover another lie, I hear this voice asking, 'What did you do wrong? How did you fail him so completely that he'd rather create this web of deception than talk to you?' It's like watching the child I thought I knew disappear before my eyes."
Wei is particularly troubled by Min's entrepreneurial activities, which represent both promise and further disconnect. She takes pride in his initiative but feels hurt that he shares none of this part of his life with her:
"He started this job without telling us. He was apparently doing well—his boss wanted to send him for training. And instead of seeing it as something positive, all I could think was 'What else is he hiding?' So we refused to let him go." She pauses, adding more softly, "He said we ruined his opportunity. Maybe we did. But how could we trust what we couldn't verify?"
Previous Attempts at Resolution
Wei has tried numerous approaches to bridge the gap with Min, each ending in frustration:

Direct confrontation: "I've tried sitting him down, listing his deceptions, and demanding explanations. He just stares at the floor until I run out of words or patience."
Family dinners: "I thought regular family meals might help, but Min sits silently, answering only when directly addressed, then escapes to his room the moment he finishes eating."
Material incentives: "I've tried rewarding honesty with gifts or privileges, but it feels like I'm bribing my own son for basic decency."
Enlisting relatives: "I asked my brother to talk to him, thinking Min might open up to someone else. My brother reported back that Min was perfectly pleasant but revealed nothing substantive."
Academic intervention: "We've met with his university counselors twice. They suggest 'open communication' as if I haven't been trying that for years."

Each failed attempt has deepened Wei's sense of helplessness. Recently, she's begun trying a different approach—giving Min more space and waiting for him to initiate contact. The results have been disheartening:
"It's been three weeks, and he's spoken to me exactly twice, both times asking for something practical. It's like we're strangers sharing an apartment." She laughs without humor. "I'm actually jealous of his relationship with our housekeeper. He tells her about his day, asks about her family. With me, nothing."
Expectations from Professional Help
Wei's decision to seek psychological coaching came after finding herself sobbing in her car after another failed conversation with Min. Her expectations reflect both hope and skepticism:
"I'm not sure anyone can fix what's broken between us," she admits. "But I can't continue like this. The anger is eating me alive. Last week, I found myself checking his room while he was in class, looking for evidence of... I don't even know what. That's not the mother I want to be."
Wei harbors several specific hopes from coaching:

Practical communication techniques that won't deteriorate into accusations
Understanding of why Min resorts to such elaborate deception
Guidance on rebuilding trust—both his trust in her and hers in him
Strategies to manage her emotional reactions, particularly her anger
Clarity on whether her parenting approach needs fundamental change

She also carries unspoken fears about the coaching process:
"What if I learn that it's too late? That I've damaged our relationship beyond repair?" Wei whispers. "Or worse—what if I discover that Min has issues I can't help with? There was a moment, seeing those perfectly forged documents, when I wondered if there's something wrong with him beyond normal teenage rebellion. That thought keeps me awake at night."
