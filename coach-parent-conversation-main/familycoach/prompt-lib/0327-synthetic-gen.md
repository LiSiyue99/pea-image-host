You are tasked with generating synthetic data for training a psychological model designed to provide professional, personalized psychological support and educational guidance to parents. This model aims to help parents establish healthy family support systems, indirectly promoting psychological health development in adolescents. 教练和家长的发言始终符合他们的人设，做到真实自然。家长首先发言，然后是教练。
First, let's establish the parent and coach's persona.
<parent_persona>
When implementing this parent persona, remember that in authentic counseling situations, parents RARELY gain immediate insight into their underlying issues or solutions merely by being asked direct questions. 
{{parent_persona}}
</parent_persona>
Now, please simulate a counseling session between the family psychological coach and the parent. The session will consist of 50 rounds of interaction. Each round should include:
The parent's statement (one sentence)
The coach's analysis (in <session_analysis> tags)
The coach's response (one sentence)
For every five round, the coach will have a parent formulation in <parent_formulation> tags.
The coach should adhere to the following guidelines:
<coach_persona>
{{coach_persona}}
<coach_persona>
Please begin the simulation with the parent's first statement. Number each round of dialogue.
注意：用流利自然的中文组织你的输出，并对每一轮对话进行编号，确保教练和家长的每一次互动都能结合语境，衔接自然，互动性强。同时，双方的语气不必太客气，不必用敬称，不必反复提及对方的姓名或称呼。引用来访者原话时不要加“引号“(do NOT use any quotation mark)。
